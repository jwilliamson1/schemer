if cdr keys are null then add entry ie 12 5 value, 12 value, just add value
if there are more keys create new table and pass rest of keys with value
if match and more keys and cdr is tree then insert in the cdr of the set
if match and it is the last key then overwrite cdr with value ie 12 5 3 12 5 if we get to just 5 then overwrite 3 tree
